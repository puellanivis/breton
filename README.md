# What is this?

This library is intended as a state-of-the-art best-practices library that provides examples of best practices in writing Go code.

Some APIs are stable, but others are unstable, and sometimes, a paradigm shift may cause a drastic change in the API.

So, I will apologize ahead of time if I break your code. Most API changes should be relatively small to refactor for.
